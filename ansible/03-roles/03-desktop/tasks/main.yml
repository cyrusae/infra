# Applied to nodes in the [desktops] group.
# Currently empty beyond what common provides -- desktops don't need
# power management changes the way laptops do.

# Babbage's isolcpus kernel parameter is NOT here -- it lives in
# roles/babbage_quirks, applied explicitly in site.yml only to babbage.
# Turing and any future desktop nodes will get this role without
# inheriting Babbage's hardware defect workaround.
